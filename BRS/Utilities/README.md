# Utilities
## - Folder's Contents
The Utilities folder is a folder which directly contains classes or scripts used by a bunch of larger scripts or classes inside the BRS Python Library. An example of this could be _**states.py**_. This one contains the states that something can be in. Since that something can be anything, it is considered as an Utility.

### - - Utilities Categories:
Generic utilities do not have categories. However, specific utilities such as the ones located in the GUI folder will be stored inside their respective categories. An example can be the Font class which is a specific GUI utility.
